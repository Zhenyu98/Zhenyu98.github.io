title: "Resolution Enhancement for mmWave Radar with Matrix-Pencil based Coherent Extension"
collection: publications
category: manuscripts
permalink: /publication/TCE-letter
excerpt: 'This paper proposes a super-resolution strategy for mmWave radar. Using the matrix-pencil method, principal components of radar signals are estimated, and phase differences between successive chirps are compensated through signal reconstruction. By coherently linking chirps, the radar's equivalent bandwidth is expanded, significantly improving resolution. Simulations demonstrate its advantages over existing algorithms, with potential applications in vital sign detection and life-care radar systems.'
