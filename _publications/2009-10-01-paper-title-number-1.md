excerpt: 'This paper addresses the super-resolution challenge in range and angle estimation for mmWave FMCW radar. It introduces a Modified Diagonal Loading (MDL) method to enhance the Iterative Adaptive Approach (IAA) for range estimation, especially in low SNR scenarios. The method adjusts dynamically based on noise levels, outperforming traditional techniques. A coherent extension technique is then applied to correct phase discontinuities across chirps, enabling longer signal construction for super-resolution range-angle mapping. Practical examples showcase its potential for high-precision point clouds, making it suitable for automotive radar and consumer IoT applications.'
