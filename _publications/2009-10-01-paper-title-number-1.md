excerpt: 'This article delves into the super-resolution problem
of range and angle for millimeter wave (mmWave) frequencymodulated continuous wave radar. First, a modified diagonal
loading (MDL) is proposed for range estimation in practical
scenarios to improve the convergence of the iterative adaptive
approach (IAA). This loading term can be flexibly adjusted
according to the actual noise level, and it has the potential
to surpass the existing adaptive diagonal loading IAA under
low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Second, the range estimation
results are used to signal enhancement. A coherent extension
technique is adopted to address the phase discontinuity between
adjacent chirps, thus enabling the construction of a longer chirp
signal. Finally, the extended signal is employed to obtain a superresolution range-angle map. Practical and numerical examples
are used to demonstrate the feasibility of the above methodology.
The proposed method can be easily deployed to automotive radar
to generate high-precision point clouds, showing potential for
widespread application in consumer vehicular IoT systems.'
